title: 'Reader-Writer Problem: Concurrency Control'

When two overlapping transactions are executing concurrently, both involve modifying the same set of overlapping data, neither one of them should observe partial results of the other to maintain consistency.
An example for partial results would be a state where a thread has updated some parts of the data but not all of them.
In this case, any read to the data that is in the middle of being updated can be accessing potentially inconsistent and corrupted data.

## Readers-writer lock

To solve the reader-writer problem, one of the solutions is to use a readers-writer lock.

- Readers can access database when there are no writers
- Writers can access database when there are no readers/writers
- Only one thread can manipulate shared variables at any time

- It means, when a writer is writing data, no other threads are able to do anything including both reads and writes.
- When a reader is reading data, then other readers are allowed to read the same data.
